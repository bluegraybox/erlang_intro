# Erlang Intro

Introductory presentation on Erlang, tentatively titled "Erlang, Your New Favorite Scripting Language?"

Includes Showoff slideshow and notes.

Now also includes an S9 version, which is a bit simpler.

To install S9/Slideshow and the S6 theme:

    sudo gem install slideshow
    slideshow -f http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s6-syntax-highlighter/raw/master/s6syntax.txt

To generate the slides:

    slideshow -t s6syntax.txt slides

This will generate a slides.html file, which you can just open in a browser.
