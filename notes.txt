What's cool about Erlang

Scalability, Performance
    nine 9s uptime
    1000s reqs/sec
    spawning, mananging processes, IPC baked in
    update code while running
But what do I use it for
    You don't want to be building applications like that in a language you don't know
    I have trouble coming up with a project that needs all that
Elegance
    concise & expressive
    part of what's cool about Erlang is what's cool about functional languages
    special features
Reading Erlang in 2 min
    atom - :atom in Ruby, "atom" in Java (or global enumerated type?)
    Variable - final
    tuple - don't worry about it
Overload
    Java - by parameter number, type
    Erlang - by value

    _ - the "whatever" variable, like /dev/null for var assignments and * for matching
